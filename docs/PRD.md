# SuperClaw Pure — Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2026-03-11
**Author:** Alice 🐕 (PO) + Danilo C (Founder)

---

## 1. Vision

**SuperClaw Pure** is a standalone, user-agnostic AI agent platform that anyone can install and start using in under 5 minutes. It combines the best ideas from OpenClaw, CoWork-OS, and Spacebot into a clean, web-first experience with its own LLM engine, structured memory, and governed execution.

**One-liner:** *The personal AI assistant that actually works out of the box.*

### Non-Goals (v1)
- Multi-user / community features (that's Spacebot's niche)
- Mobile native app (PWA is sufficient)
- Cloud-hosted SaaS (self-hosted only for v1)
- Marketplace / paid skills

---

## 2. User Personas

### P1: "The Curious" (Beginner)
- Heard about AI agents, wants to try
- Not a developer, doesn't know what LLM means
- Needs: one-click install, guided setup, immediate value
- Pain: "I tried OpenClaw and gave up after 2 days"

### P2: "The Power User" (Advanced)
- Running OpenClaw or similar for months
- Has custom skills, complex workflows, multiple channels
- Needs: smart routing, persistent memory, cost control
- Pain: "Token burn, context amnesia, agent loops"

### P3: "The Builder" (Developer)
- Wants to extend, build custom tools, contribute
- Needs: clean API, plugin system, good docs
- Pain: "Codebase feels vibe-coded, hard to contribute"

prompt injection vectors. SuperClaw Pure curates a **safe, rewritten skill library** — every skill is
code-reviewed, sandboxed, and tested before publishing.

| S043d | Select top 18 skills for clean rewrite | Prioritized by user demand, diversity across 18 categories |
| S043e | Rewrite selected skills (clean-room, zero deps where possible) | Each skill: SKILL.md + scripts + tests, no copy-paste from originals |
| S043f | Skill Hub API + UI | Browse, search, install, rate skills from `/skills` panel |
| S043g | Skill sandboxing | Skills run in restricted context, no raw shell unless approved |
| S043h | Skill verification badge (✅ Curated) | Visual indicator for audited vs community-contributed skills |

**Target categories for curation:**
- 🔍 Web search / research
- 📊 Data analysis / visualization
- ✍️ Content creation / writing
- 🗓️ Calendar / scheduling / reminders
- 📧 Email management
- 💻 Coding assistance
- 🏠 Smart home / IoT
